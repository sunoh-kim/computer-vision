# Computer Vision - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my assignment solutions for the Introduction to Computer Vision course (430.711A_001) offered by Seoul National University (Spring 2018).

The algorithms for the assignments are implemented using MATLAB.

### Photometric Stereo:
Photometric stereo is a technique to estimate the surface normals of objects by observing the object under different lighting conditions.

### Image Stitching:
Image stitching is the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image.

### Object Detection:
Object detection is a technique to detect instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in images or videos.
